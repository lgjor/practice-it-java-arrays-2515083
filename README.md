# Practice It: Java Arrays

Do you have experience using arrays in Java? Want to put your knowledge to the test or get more experience? If so, check out this course, as instructor Kathryn Hodge presents a series of challenges centered around real-world problems you might encounter and use arrays to solve. After a short review of the basics of how to work with the array data structure, Kathryn jumps into the challenges, testing your knowledge and abilities of looping through arrays, using the modulo operator with arrays, working with array indices, and more. If you’re looking to improve your command of Java arrays, get started on the path to mastery with these carefully chosen challenges and detailed solutions.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.



## Exercises

- Find the second smaller number of an array.
- Create a program that displays a right triangle with the contents in an object array
  - If the array contains 1 item, just 1 item should be printed
  - if the array is empty nothing should be printed
- Rotate and array to the right, returning a new array. Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, Output: {5, 1, 2, 3, 4} 
- Move all the zeros to the end of the array. Return void. 
- Reverse an array in place. Input: {1,2,3,4,5}. Output: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} (same array)
