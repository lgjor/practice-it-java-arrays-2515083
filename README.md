Do you have experience using arrays in Java? Want to put your knowledge to the test or get more experience? If so, check out this course, as instructor Kathryn Hodge presents a series of challenges centered around real-world problems you might encounter and use arrays to solve. After a short review of the basics of how to work with the array data structure, Kathryn jumps into the challenges, testing your knowledge and abilities of looping through arrays, using the modulo operator with arrays, working with array indices, and more. If you’re looking to improve your command of Java arrays, get started on the path to mastery with these carefully chosen challenges and detailed solutions.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.



## Exercises

- Find the second smaller number of an array.
- Create a program that displays a right triangle with the contents in an object array
  - If the array contains 1 item, just 1 item should be printed
  - if the array is empty nothing should be printed
- Rotate and array to the right, returning a new array. Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, Output: {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
